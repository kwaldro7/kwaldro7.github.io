            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>ITSC 3688 - Computers and Their Impact on Society: </b>A required course, but definitely one that is valuable, because I want to enhance my teamwork and presentation skills.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>ITCS 3160 - Database Design and Implementation: </b>A required course, but I would take it anyway to learn SQL because I am interested in Data Science.
                </li>

                    <b>HIST 2207 - Modern Latin America: </b>I needed a non-Western history course in order to qualify for the History minor.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>ITSC 3155 - Software Engineering: </b>A required course, but it will also be good to learn some HTML and CSS from there and incorporate it into ITIS 3135.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>ITIS 3135 - Web-Based Application Design and Development: </b>I am interested in how websites work, especially the process of making them. I hope I get my own personal website out of this course that I can use to show potential employers.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                <b>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember me by: </b>As a native from Indiana, I have to cheer for the Colts (even though we are NOT winning a Super Bowl in the foreseeable future).

            <li>
                <b>I'd also like to Share: </b>Blasting Disney songs makes any drive 100% better.
